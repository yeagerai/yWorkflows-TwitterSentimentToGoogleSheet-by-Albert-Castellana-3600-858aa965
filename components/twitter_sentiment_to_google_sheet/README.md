# Component Name

TwitterSentimentToGoogleSheet

# Description

The TwitterSentimentToGoogleSheet component is a Yeager Workflow component that takes a list of Twitter handles and credentials as input, retrieves sentiment analysis of tweets related to those handles, and writes the output into a Google Sheet, returning the Google Sheet URL as output. This component is designed to bridge the gap between Twitter's Sentiment Analysis API and Google Sheets.

# Input and Output Models

**Input Model:**

TwitterHandlesIn: Consists of two main fields:

- `handles`: List[str] - List of Twitter handles as strings.
- `credentials`: Dict[str, Any] - Dictionary containing credentials to authenticate the input Twitter handles, and the Google Sheets API.

**Output Model:**

GoogleSheetURLOut: Consists of one main field:

- `url`: str - The URL of the Google Sheet where the sentiment analysis output is written.

Both input and output models use Pydantic for data validation and serialization.

# Parameters

- `args`: TwitterHandlesIn - The input object containing the list of Twitter handles and necessary credentials.
- `callbacks`: typing.Any - A callback function used to communicate progress and state changes with external components, currently not utilized.

# Transform Function

The `transform()` function processes the input data and returns output data as follows:

1. Calls the superclass's `transform()` method with the passed `args` and `callbacks`. The superclass handles the sentiment analysis of tweets and ensures the data is in the proper format.
2. Extracts the Google Sheet URL from the transform results.
3. Returns the output data as an instance of GoogleSheetURLOut with the Google Sheet URL.

# External Dependencies

This component relies on the following external libraries:

- `typing`: Provides type hinting for Python.
- `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a .env file.
- `fastapi`: Allows for the creation of APIs with minimal code.
- `pydantic`: Provides data validation and serialization for input and output models.

# API Calls

This component makes use of the Twitter API and Google Sheets API to fetch sentiment analysis of tweets and write the results to a Google Sheet. The superclass methods handle the interaction with these APIs, ensuring correct API usage.

# Error Handling

The component handles errors by raising exceptions from the superclass's `transform()` method, the Twitter API, and the Google Sheets API. These exceptions will propagate through the program, and callers are expected to handle them accordingly.

# Examples

An example of using the TwitterSentimentToGoogleSheet component within a Yeager Workflow:

1. Configure the necessary credentials for the Twitter API and Google Sheets API in a `.env` file.
2. Instantiate the `TwitterHandlesIn` object with the desired list of Twitter handles and necessary credentials.
3. Call the `transform()` method on a `TwitterSentimentToGoogleSheet` instance with the prepared input object.
4. Receive the populated `GoogleSheetURLOut` object as output, containing the URL for the Google Sheet with the sentiment analysis results.
