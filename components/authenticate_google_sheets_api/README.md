# Component Name
AuthenticateGoogleSheetsAPI

## Description
This component is designed to authenticate access to the Google Sheets API, an essential step in interacting with Google Sheets resources within a Yeager Workflow. The AuthenticateGoogleSheetsAPI component generates a service object after a successful authentication, which can be used in subsequent components to perform various Google Sheets operations.

## Input and Output Models
The input and output models for this component are as follows:

### Input Model
- **AuthenticateGoogleSheetsAPIInputDict**
  - credentials (Union[str, dict]): The Google API service account JSON, which can either be in the form of a string or a dictionary.

### Output Model
- **AuthenticateGoogleSheetsAPIOutputDict**
  - service_object (object): The authenticated Google Sheets API service object for performing further operations.

The input and output models use the Pydantic BaseModel for validation and serialization purposes.

## Parameters
The component contains the following parameters:

- api_version (str): The version of the Google Sheets API to use. It is defined in the component configuration file.
- scope (str): The OAuth2 scope required for the Google Sheets API, specified in the component configuration file.

## Transform Function
The transform() method in `AuthenticateGoogleSheetsAPI` is responsible for the following steps:

1. Parse the input `args` (AuthenticateGoogleSheetsAPIInputDict) and retrieve the `credentials` JSON.
2. Conditionally, if `credentials` is a string, convert it into a dictionary.
3. Create a `Credentials` object using the `from_service_account_info()` method, providing the `credentials` dictionary and the `scope`.
4. Instantiate the Google Sheets API service object using the `build()` method, providing the API name, version, and credentials.
5. Return the AuthenticateGoogleSheetsAPIOutputDict with the authenticated `service_object`.

## External Dependencies
The following external libraries and dependencies are used by the component:

- **googleapiclient**: For building and authenticating the Google Sheets API service object.
- **google.oauth2.service_account**: For creating credentials from the JSON input.
- **fastapi**: For REST API implementation in the Yeager Workflow.
- **pydantic**: For input and output type validation and serialization.
- **dotenv**: For loading the environment variables.

## API Calls
The component calls the following API:

- Google Sheets API: To authenticate and create a service object for subsequent operations.

## Error Handling
Throughout the transform method, error handling is done based on errors that may occur during the input processing, parsing, and API authentication. The Google Sheets API and credential creation might raise specific exceptions if there's an issue with the authentication.

## Examples
To use this component within a Yeager Workflow, follow these steps:

1. Configure the component by creating a `component_configuration.yaml` file with the `api_version` and `scope` parameters.
2. Instantiate the component and then call its transform method by providing the AuthenticateGoogleSheetsAPIInputDict object, containing the JSON string or dictionary of the Google API service account.
